# jsonresume-theme-one

There were some things that seemed super broken with this theme, but I liked it a lot. So I fixed it up a bit.

A compact theme for JSON Resume, designed for printing. 

Tries to fit as much information as possible onto a single page without making sections look cluttered.

## Example

http://themes.jsonresume.org/theme/one

## Running

```
sudo npm install -g resume-cli
git clone https://github.com/phillipchaffee/jsonresume-theme-one.git
cd jsonresume-theme-one
resume serve
```
You can print directly from the served html.
